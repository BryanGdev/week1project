		<p>Almost Home Dog Rescue of NJ (AHDR), is a 501 (c) 3 organization with volunteers having over 20 years experience in animal rescue.<br>
			 Because we have no shelter facility, we rely on volunteers to take our dogs into their homes and care for them until they are adopted.<br>
			 We get our dogs from different situations like pounds, shelters & owner surrenders. Our goal is to help mend these broken hearts and<br>
			 bodies and place them into their new loving forever homes</p>
